## Description ##
This repository contains Phase 1 submitted to DM course offered in Fall 2020 at PafKiet. It is hosted on https://inspiring-jennings-346630.netlify.app/

## Introduction ##
Warshall algorithm is for finding the shortest parth between all the pairs of vertices in a waited graph. At the beginning of the algorithm we input a NN matrix yhtough input and in this input type = "text" generate a 100 100 matrix randomly and in this 100 * 100 matrix we get a matrix according to the input we get from input type="text" for example(i.e. 4 <= N <= 100). Now separate a commas and space from the matrix 100 * 100 matrix and store it in var. Then implement this algorithm.

## Time Complexity ##
Time Complexity is O(n^3)

## Approach ##
First we need to take the input from textarea and run the algo to the desired input, Then we use performance.now() to calculate the time taken by the algo at the lowest matrix possibale then we work our way upto the desired input. After that the output is shown by js

## Performance.now() ##
The performance.now() method will return a timestamp in milliseconds of how long itâ€™s been since you loaded the page.
